  <p>The Kangla Palace (Meitei: /kəŋ.la/[1]), popularly as well as officially known as the Kangla Fort,[2] is an old 
    fortified palace at Imphal in the Manipur state of India.[3][4][5] It was formerly situated on both sides 
    (western and eastern) of the bank of the 
    Imphal River, now remaining only on the western side in ruined conditions. Kangla means "the prominent 
    part of the dry land" in old Meetei.[6] It was the traditional seat of the past Meetei rulers of Manipur.
